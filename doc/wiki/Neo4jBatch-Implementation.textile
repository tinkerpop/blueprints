```

@Neo4jBatchGraph@ provides support for the bulk insertion of data into a "Neo4j":http://neo4j.org graph. This Blueprints implementation is single-threaded and non-transactional. It is meant for initial dumps of raw data into a Neo4j graph and is much faster than doing the equivalent process using @Neo4jGraph@ (see [[Neo4j Implementation]]).

*Note*: This is not a pure Blueprints implementation as numerous methods throw an @UnsupportedOperationException@. Those that due are primarily delete methods. Be sure to review the respective JavaDoc for information on method peculiarities.
