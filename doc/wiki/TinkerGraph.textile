TinkerGraph is a lightweight, "POJO":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_Old_Java_Object based, in-memory property graph that serves as the reference implementation for the [[property graph model]]. If you have a small graph that can be loaded and saved using the [[GraphML reader and writer library]], then TinkerGraph can be handy to use. TinkerGraph packaged with the core Blueprints distribution.

```java
Graph graph = new TinkerGraph();
Graph graph = new TinkerGraph("/tmp/tinkergraph"); // on graph.shutdown() the graph is serialized to disk
```

There is a hardcoded representation of the graph diagrammed in [[Property Graph Model]]. This is useful as a small, play dataset to get acquainted with the Blueprints API.

```java
Graph graph = TinkerGraphFactory.createTinkerGraph();
```
