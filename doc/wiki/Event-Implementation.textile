@EventGraph@ and @EventIndexableGraph@ wrap any @Graph@ or @IndexableGraph@, respectively. The purpose of an @EventGraph@ is to raise events to one or more @GraphChangedListener@ as changes to the underlying @Graph@ occur.  The obvious limitation is that events will only be raised to listeners if the changes to the @Graph@ occur within the same process.

The following events are raised:

* New vertex
* New edge
* Vertex property changed
* Edge property changed
* Vertex property removed
* Edge property removed
* Vertex removed
* Edge removed
* Graph cleared

To start processing events from a @Graph@ first implement the @GraphChangedListener@ interface.  An example of this implementation is the @ConsoleGraphChangedListener@ which writes output to the console for each event.

To add a listener to the @EventGraph@:

```java
EventGraph graph = new EventGraph(TinkerGraphFactory.createTinkerGraph());
graph.addListener(new ConsoleGraphChangedListener(graph));

Vertex v = graph.addVertex(100);
v.setProperty("name", "noname");

for (Edge edge : graph.getEdges()) {
    edge.removeProperty("weight");
}

graph.clear();
```

The following output would appear in the console:

```text
Vertex [v[100]] added to graph [eventgraph[tinkergraph[vertices:6 edges:6]]]
Vertex [v[4]] property [name] set to value of [noname] in graph [eventgraph[tinkergraph[vertices:6 edges:6]]]
Edge [e[10][4-created->5]] property [weight] with value of [1.0] removed in graph [eventgraph[tinkergraph[vertices:6 edges:6]]]
Edge [e[7][1-knows->2]] property [weight] with value of [0.5] removed in graph [eventgraph[tinkergraph[vertices:6 edges:6]]]
Edge [e[9][1-created->3]] property [weight] with value of [0.4] removed in graph [eventgraph[tinkergraph[vertices:6 edges:6]]]
Edge [e[8][1-knows->4]] property [weight] with value of [1.0] removed in graph [eventgraph[tinkergraph[vertices:6 edges:6]]]
Edge [e[11][4-created->3]] property [weight] with value of [0.4] removed in graph [eventgraph[tinkergraph[vertices:6 edges:6]]]
Edge [e[12][6-created->3]] property [weight] with value of [0.2] removed in graph [eventgraph[tinkergraph[vertices:6 edges:6]]]
Graph [eventgraph[tinkergraph[vertices:6 edges:6]]] cleared.
