"Rexster":http://rexster.tinkerpop.com is a RESTful graph shell that exposes any Blueprints graph through a standalone HTTP server. @RexsterGraph@ talks to a Rexster-exposed graph via the "Rexster RESTful API":https://github.com/tinkerpop/rexster/wiki/Basic-REST-API. Thus, @RexsterGraph@ can be used to communicate with a remote graph with complete HTTP-transparency to the user. @RexsterGraph@ is composed of HTTP calls (through @java.net.*@) and "JSON":http://json.org/ parsing (through "JSON-simple":http://code.google.com/p/json-simple/).

```java
Graph graph = new RexsterGraph("http://localhost:8182/graphs/tinkergraph");
```
