@Neo4jHaGraph@ provides support for the Neo4j "High Availability Cluster (HA)":http://wiki.neo4j.org/content/High_Availability_Cluster which provides a fault-tolerant database structure and horizontal scaling capability.  Instantiating the @Neo4jHaGraph@ class requires several configuration elements as shown in the sample above as well as a running "Zookeeper":http://zookeeper.apache.org/ cluster for HA coordination.  Setting up the cluster is described "here":http://wiki.neo4j.org/content/High_Availability_Cluster.
