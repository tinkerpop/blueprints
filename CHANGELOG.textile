<dependency>
  <groupId>com.tinkerpop.blueprints</groupId>
  <artifactId>blueprints-core</artifactId>
  <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

* Bumped to support Neo4j 1.4.1
* RexsterGraph uses the actual count REST API instead of pulling back all results first and checking size.

h3. Version 0.9 (Marvin -- August 1, 2011)

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.tinkerpop.blueprints</groupId>
  <artifactId>blueprints-core</artifactId>
  <version>0.9</version>
</dependency>
```

* Updated Vertex API to have @getOutEdges(String...)@ and @getInEdges(String...)@
* Updated @TinkerGraph@ to be @ConcurrentModificationException@ safe
* Bumped to support Neo4j 1.4
* Bumped to support OrientDB 1.0rc4
* @IndexableGraph.getIndex()@ now return @null@ for non-existent indices instead of @RuntimeException@
* Added support for statement deduplication (now the default) in @GraphSail@
* Refactored @GraphMLReader@ and @GraphMLWriter@ to use a more typical pattern for readers and writers (rather than continuing to overload @inputGraph()@ and @outputGraph()@).  Added normalizing functionality to @GraphMLWriter@, enabling graph versioning
* Changed the property graph schema of @GraphSail@ to more closely resemble the @SailGraph@ schema
* Extended @GraphSail@ to support Sesame-style inferencing
* @SailGraph@ dangling connection issue fixed
* Updated @Index.toString()@ to make it more readable and compact
* Updated @graph.getVertex/Edge(null)@ to ensure that @null@ is returned
