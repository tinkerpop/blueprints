```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.tinkerpop.blueprints</groupId>
  <artifactId>blueprints-core</artifactId>
  <version>1.1</version>
</dependency>
```

* Fixed index consistency issue in @OrientGraph@
* Added @Neo4jHaGraph@ allowing a more direct way to utilize Neo4j High Availability mode
* General API consistency improvements
** Graphs attempt to create directories structures for graph persistence
** GetVertex/Edge throw @IllegalArgumentException@ if passed a null identifier as a parameter.
** GetVertex/Edge return @null@ if the element cannot be found, if the identifier does not match the expected format of the underlying graph database or if the underlying graph database throws exceptions during the lookup.
* @RexsterGraph@ utilizes the @application/vnd.rexster.typed+json@ custom mime type
* The @EventGraph.addEdge()@ method now properly fires the @onEdgeAdded@ event with improved test cases
* Added @WrappedGraph@ as a template for how to build stackable graph implementations
* Added @SparqlRepositorySailGraph@ to support a @Graph@ representation of any SPARQL endpoint
* Renamed @GraphJSONxxx@ to @GraphSONxxx@ to promote as standardized JSON graph format
* Bumped to support OrientDB 1.0rc7
* Bumped to support Neo4j 1.5
