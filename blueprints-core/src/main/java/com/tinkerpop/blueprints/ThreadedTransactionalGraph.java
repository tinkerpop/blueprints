/**
 * ThreadedTransactionalGraph provides more fine grained control over the transactional context.
 * While TransactionalGraph binds each transaction to the executing thread, ThreadedTransactionalGraph's {@link #startTransaction} returns a {@link TransactionalGraph} that represents its own transactional context independent of the executing thread.
 * Hence, one can have multiple threads operating against a single transaction represented by the returned TransactionalGraph object. This is useful for parallelizing graph algorithms.
 * <p/>
 * Note, that one needs to call {@link TransactionalGraph#commit()} or {@link TransactionalGraph#rollback()} to close the transactions returned
 * by {@link #startTransaction()}.
